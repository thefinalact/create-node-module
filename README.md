A very simple way to create a node module.

# Testing
Run your tests (located in *test.js*) with
> npm test

The test runner is set to 'watch' files  by default, so test will run everytime the code is changed.

# Run from command line
Rename the file *myapp-cli.js* to your app's name.

Also find and replace references to *myapp* in this file.
